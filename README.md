# bankingApp
This is a project I made on JavaScript which is a great Banking App in which you can transfer money, login account, see your balance, etc.

Some of the usernames you can use when running the app: 

Username 1: JS ; Password: 1111

Username 2: AS ; Password: 2222

Username 3: AN ; Password: 3333

Username 4: SF ; Password: 4444

Please don't claim as your own. Thanks!
